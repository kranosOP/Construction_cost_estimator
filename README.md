# Construction Project Cost Estimator
The Construction Project Cost Estimator is a C++ program that estimates the total cost of a construction project based on material and labor data. The program reads input files containing material and labor details, calculates their associated costs, and generates a cost summary for review.

Features:
Loads material data from a file (materials.txt).
Loads labor data from a file (labor.txt).
Calculates total material and labor costs.
Saves the cost summary to a file (cost_summary.txt).
Displays the cost summary.
Allows updating material or labor data interactively.
Setup Instructions:
Step 1: Prepare Input Files
Create two text files:

materials.txt: Contains material details like name, price per unit, and quantity.
labor.txt: Contains labor details like type, cost per hour, and hours required.
Ensure these files are in the same directory as the program's source code file.

Step 2: Compile and Run the Program
Compile the program to create an executable.
Run the executable to process the input files, calculate the costs, and display the results.
Step 3: Cost Summary
After running the program, the cost summary will be saved in cost_summary.txt. This file will contain the total material cost, total labor cost, and the grand total.

Example Content of cost_summary.txt:
Total Material Cost: The total cost for materials based on the quantities and unit prices.
Total Labor Cost: The total cost for labor based on the hours and hourly rates.
Grand Total Cost: The combined total of material and labor costs.
